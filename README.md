Hackathon 2017: 
We decided to create a project using Amazon Web Services and the Unity engine. What resulted was a python script that communicated with the Lex component of Amazon Web Services to process text command. It would then return a result that would be used in another python script that would write a C# code. This code would be used by the unity engine to perform actions. For example, the command “add a cube” could be sent to the python script and result in a cube being created in the unity environment.
